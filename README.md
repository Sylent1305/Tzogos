## Game Flow

Each **hand** consists of **four rounds**, with players gradually using up their cards. A hand ends when all four rounds are played, and then a new hand begins with a new 7-card hand per player.

### Round Structure (Per Hand)

| Round | Card Play Style                                    | Notes                              |
|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| 1     | **First card face-down**, then **second face-up**  | Standard round                      |
| 2     | **Both cards face-down**                           | Hidden showdown                     |
| 3     | **First card face-up**, then **second face-down**  | Reverse of Round 1                  |
| 4     | **One card face-down** + **1 community card**      | Final round, with shared card       |

Each round follows this structure:

1. All players place an **ante** (small forced bet).  
2. Card placement based on round style.  
3. **First betting round** (Pot-Limit).  
4. After both cards are placed, **second betting round**.  
5. Cards are revealed ‚Üí Scores calculated ‚Üí Highest score wins the pot.  
6. In case of a tie, perform a [tie-breaker draw](#tie-breaker).  

> Players **do not draw new cards** during the hand.  
> After 4 rounds, the hand ends, and a new hand begins with new cards.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Folding Rule**: If a player folds **after placing only one card**, they must **discard** an additional card from their hand immediately, following the round‚Äôs placement rules (face-up or face-down). This keeps the game state balanced.

---

## Pot-Limit Betting

- A raise may **not exceed** the size of the current pot.  
- Minimum raise must match the previous bet or raise.  
- Two betting rounds per hand: after each card placement.

> Example: If the pot is 20 chips, the maximum raise is 20.

---

## Player Actions

- **Check** ‚Äì Pass without betting (only allowed if no bet is active).  
- **Raise** ‚Äì Bet any amount up to the pot size.  
- **Call** ‚Äì Match the current highest bet.  
- **Fold** ‚Äì Forfeit your hand and exit the round (see [Folding Rules](#folding-rules)).

---

## Folding Rules

When a player **folds**, they give up the chance to win the pot. However:

- **Cards already placed** remain on the table and **can still be affected by jokers**.
- If the player folded **after placing only one card**, they must:
  - **Immediately discard** an additional card from their hand.
  - This card must match the round's placement rule (**face-down or face-up**).
- Folded players take no further actions in the round.

> üÉè Jokers can still swap with **folded player‚Äôs cards**.  
> üéØ This preserves the board and strategic elements even after a fold.

---

## Joker Rules

- A joker may be used **before taking your action**.  
- Using a joker allows you to **replace** one card (face-down or face-up) of an opponent with one card from your own hand.  
- After using a joker, **draw 1 card** from the deck to restore your hand to 7 cards.

> Jokers have a value of 0 and are used purely for tactical disruption.

| 2‚Äì10   | Face value |
| J      | 11        |
| Q      | 12        |
| K      | 13        |
| A      | 14        |

## Scoring

Each player scores based on the **sum of their two played cards**, plus **one applicable bonus**.

### Bonus Combinations

| Combination             | Bonus Points |
|-------------------------|--------------|
| Flush (same suit)       | +3           |
| Straight (consecutive)  | +5           |
| Pair (same rank)        | +7           |
| Straight Flush          | +10          |

> Notes:
> - A straight may be A‚Äì2 (Ace counts as low).  
> - Only the **highest** applicable bonus is counted.  
> - A **Straight Flush** replaces both the Straight and Flush bonuses.

### Examples

- **Flush only**:  
  10‚ô• + Q‚ô• ‚Üí (10 + 12) + 3 = **25**

- **Straight only**:  
  J‚ô£ + Q‚ô¶ ‚Üí (11 + 12) + 5 = **28**

- **Straight Flush**:  
  J‚ô• + Q‚ô• ‚Üí (11 + 12) + 10 = **33**

## Tie Breaker

In case of a scoring tie:

1. Each tied player draws one card from the deck.  
2. Highest card wins the pot.  
3. If tied again, repeat the draw.
